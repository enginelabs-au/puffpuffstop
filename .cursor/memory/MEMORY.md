# Working memory

## Durable directives

- Execute agent-capable work directly; do not delegate routine implementation or investigation to the user.
- Use the sequential planning lifecycle for new projects and major implementations: phase 0 maps the full project, each later phase plan is generated only after the previous phase is implemented and verified, and closure produces `docs/plans/final_implementation_checklist.md`.
- Defer non-blocking human-only actions and missing credential values to the final phase while completing all possible code, configuration, adapters, tests, documentation, and environment-variable wiring first.
- Read `/AGENTS.md` first on every substantive turn and route detailed instructions through `/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- Use `/launch-pipeline` and `/instructions/LAUCH.md` as the linked entry point for a raw idea, major change, resume, remediation, or closure.
- Launch is preflight-first and bootstrap-gated: run read-only `/skills/launch-pipeline/scripts/preflight.mjs` before mode selection. Every pre-Build Cursor plan must close with `bash .cursor/scripts/bootstrap.sh` as the first post-Build action, then run that command after Build or explicit Agent-mode implementation authorization.
- Use adaptive role routing for substantive work: record required/skipped canonical roles, require role charters before action, and preserve evidence-backed handoffs under `docs/workstreams/`.
- Treat prompts and role identities as guidance, not production authorization; deterministic policy and external access controls govern sensitive actions.
- Never store passwords, tokens, private keys, or secret values in agent markdown, plans, memories, logs, or templates.

## Memory role

This file is a concise durable memory and index. Store only standing directives, stable decisions, high-level architecture notes, and links to canonical detail.

Operational history belongs in `/memory/memories/YYYY-MM-DD-continuation.md` or a topic-specific memory. Unresolved issues belong in `blockers/`; exact procedures belong in `runbooks/`; stable repeatable procedures belong in `/skills/`.

## Product architecture (PuffPuffStop)

- Name/tagline locked: PuffPuffStop — “Break the cycle, reclaim your lungs.”
- 16+ wellness habit coach (not medical, not a kids app). v1 money is a local estimate ledger only.
- Stack: Expo + TypeScript + Expo Router, offline-first SQLite later, Supabase Auth/Postgres/RLS later.
- Canonical blueprint: `docs/blueprints/2026-08-18_puffpuffstop.md`
- Phase 0 plan: `docs/plans/phase_0_foundations_plan.md`
- Phase 1 plan: `docs/plans/phase_1_onboarding-plan_plan.md` (verified)
- Phase 2 plan: `docs/plans/phase_2_home-log_plan.md` (draft, not implemented)
- Workstream: `docs/workstreams/20260818-puffpuffstop-mobile-mvp/manifest.md`
